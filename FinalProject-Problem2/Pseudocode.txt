Ask the user whether they want to encrypt or decrypt.

Ask the user for a shift value (number of positions to shift letters).

Read the text from input.txt.

Apply the Caesar cipher:

Encryption: shift letters forward by the shift value.

Decryption: shift letters backward by the shift value.

Write the result to output.txt.
